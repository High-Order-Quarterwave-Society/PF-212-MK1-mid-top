# PF-212-MK1-mid-top

The PF-212-mk1 Mid Top was originaly designed by Matthew Morgan J. member of the **Higher Order Quarterwave Society** (HOQWS) which was started back in 2013 by Matthew Morgan J, Dustin Morgan (Flex Tech Designs) and J. Vansickle (Paragon Concepts) 

The PF-212-mk1 is based on a low and high tuned resonator making the design very efficient in it's bandwidth, therefore the named **Paraflex** was chosen. Many prototypes and design revisions have been made by members of the HOQWS, continualy improving the design of the cabinet and its different versions.

Other designs using the Paraflex principles where made for subwoofer and infrasonic frequency ranges. There are always new concepts and designs in progress on the [HOQWS facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bassaz/). 

# Working range
The PF-212-mk1 has a 80Hz (Fb) tuning and working range shall be 70hz to 600hz. With modified phase plug this can be extended to 900hz. bRecomended crossover setting depends on the drivers used, but a basic setting can be set with a 90hz 4th order Linkwitz Rily Highpass Filter (24dB/LR HPF) and a 600-900hz 24dB/LR LP. However we encourage the user to adjust the frequency range and filter based on their application and measurements.

# Notes
There are numerous modifications and versions of the base mk1 design.
